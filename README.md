# Tech-Blog-MVC

## Description
This project is blog where a user can create a profile, make posts, view others' posts and make comments. This project was probably the biggest one I have worked on yet, and it took an enormous amount of time and effort. To fulfill the acceptance criteria, I had to implement various features such as user authentification and CRUD routes for posts and comments. I also had to create some styling CSS for this project as well to make this application responsive and visually appealing. This project gave me a lot of experience in learning how controllers and views will work together. I learned just how much effort a full stack project will take on your own.

## Installation
    
To use this application, you will need to have Node.js installed on your desktop. Once in your code editor of choice, you will need to open your terminal and initialize npm with the command `npm init`. Once you have npm initialized, you will install npm with the command: npm install. To install all of the dependencies that we have used for this project you will use the command `npm i express sequelize mysql2 express-session bcrypt express-handlebars dotenv connect-session-sequelize handlebars path`. In order to install nodemon, you will need to use the command `npm i nodemon --save-dev`.
            
## Usage
    
The project contains a basic blog application where users can create an account, create, view and delete blog posts, and leave comments on blog posts. As a junior developer, you can study the codebase to learn how to build a basic web application with a database, authentication, and basic CRUD functionality. You can also modify and extend the code to create your own custom blog or web application.

## Contribution
    
I gained a lot of information from the activities from my coding bootcamp. The activities I specifically used were module 14 activity 19 and module 14 mini project. I also had some  assistance from my tutor Jacob Carver. Lastly, I turned to ChatGPT for guidance when stuck, and for checking my code for syntax errors.
  
## Tests
  
You can run the command "npm run watch" to use nodemon so you can keep the server running while you continue making changes without having to restart the server. Other than that there are no other tests for you to run.
